Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

1. **Project Context**:

   - This project is focused on creating an English language learning platform.
   - The platform includes features like interactive lessons, quizzes, and progress tracking.
   - The target audience is non-native English speakers looking to improve their language skills.

2. **Coding Guidelines**:

   - Follow best practices for code readability and maintainability.
   - Use meaningful variable and function names.
   - Include comments and documentation for complex logic.
   - Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes.
   - Adhere to the project's coding style and conventions.

3. **AI Interaction**:
   - When generating code, consider the overall architecture and design patterns used in the project.
   - Provide explanations and justifications for code changes or suggestions.
   - Be mindful of potential edge cases and error handling.
   - Ensure that any new code integrates seamlessly with existing features.
4. **Review Process**:
   - When reviewing changes, check for adherence to the coding guidelines.
   - Provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.
   - Ensure that all changes are well-documented and tested.
5. **Security Considerations**:
   - Be vigilant about security vulnerabilities, especially in user input handling.
   - Follow secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.
